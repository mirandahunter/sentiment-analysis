CP341 final project
Authors: Miranda, Lizzie, Walt

In our project, we wanted to try multiple different models and test how they performed on sentiment analysis. We also wanted to test on multiple types of sentiment analysis: polarity (positive vs. negative) and subjectivity (on a scale from 0-4, with 0 being most negative and 4 being most positive). We trained 3 models to do this: K-means, neural network, and BERT. 

For each type of model, we experimented to find which specific model worked best. Then, we found how well the model performed on the test data from the dataset it was trained on. Then, we experimented to see how well it performed on the test data from the dataset it was NOT trained on. Then, we were able to compare the models to see which performed best. The final results from each model are on their respective notebook pages, and we compared (verbally) the performance together in class.

Users can recreate the behavior of the code by downloading the datasets from the Github (clean_IMDBDataset.csv.zip and RottenTomatoes/DataSet/train.tsv), unzipping the IMDB dataset, then running the Jupyter Notebooks in full.
